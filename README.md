# Google-Girl-Hackathon
Multi-Modal Document Processing with AI

This project leverages advanced AI techniques, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision, to process and extract valuable insights from documents in multiple formats. The goal is to automate the extraction of text, tables, images, and other key elements from scanned, handwritten, or digitally created documents.

Key Features:
Text Extraction: Uses OCR to convert scanned documents and images into machine-readable text.
Image Processing: Detects logos, signatures, charts, and other visual elements within documents.
Table Extraction: Identifies and extracts tabular data from documents and converts it into structured formats like CSV or JSON.
Natural Language Processing: Performs text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and summarization to understand and organize textual content.
Use Cases:
Finance: Extracts financial data from invoices, receipts, and financial reports.
Business Intelligence: Automates the processing of reports and proposals to generate actionable insights from multi-modal documents.
